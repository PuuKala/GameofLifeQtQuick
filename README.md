# Game of Life Qt Quick
Game of life with Qt Quick GUI.

Made for Bootti as an interview project.

### What's in which file?
The CMakeLists.txt, CMakeLists.txt.user, .gitignore, main.cpp and qml.qrc are mainly generated by Qt.
Source files have been added to CMakeLists.txt and GameOfLife class usage added to main.cpp.

Other files have been mostly written by me.

gameoflife.* contain GameOfLife class, which acts as an image provider for Qt Quick GUI.

main.qml has the GUI, which sends commands to the GameOfLife class through image requests.

#### GameOfLife class
Acts as an QQuickImageProvider for the QML. The class takes commands through the image request path and returns the updated game state image.
